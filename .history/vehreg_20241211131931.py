#Create a Python class Vehicle with attributes registration_number, type, and owner. 
#Implement a method update_owner to change the vehicle's owner. 
# Then, create a few instances of Vehicle and demonstrate changing the owner.
#Code Example: Provide a basic structure for the Vehicle class without methods.

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, reg_num, type, owner):
        self.registration_number = reg_num
        self.type = type
        self.owner = owner

#- Expected Outcome: Completion of the Vehicle class with the update_ownermethod and
# a demonstration script showing the creation of Vehicle objects and updating their owners.
